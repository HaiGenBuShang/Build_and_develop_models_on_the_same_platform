#*YOU SHOULD NOTE THAT!!!

1. Please read the comments in the scripts named with "model_building_for" in the "Data_and_Scripts_for_manuscripts/Scripts" directory.
The comments mainly tell you that 
when you run the scripts, the scripts labeled as:
#**************
#*Script Part X
#**************
should be run separately for several times to build the model.

2. The results might be slightly different compared to the manuscript due to the data downloading order by TCGAbiolonks.
The varied results would not affect the conclusion. 
However, the results of Table 3, which generated by SEQC data with fixed sample order, are exactly the same as in the manuscript.
